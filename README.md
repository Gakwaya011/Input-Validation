# Multi-Form Flutter Application

## Overview
This project is a Flutter-based multi-form application that validates user input fields. The application consists of two screens with input fields for Name, Email, and Phone Number. The goal is to demonstrate input validation using Flutter's form validation mechanisms.

## Features
- Two screens for user input.
- Input validation for  three fields.
- Validation scripts for Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- Error messages displayed when validation fails.
- Well-structured folder organization.
- Documented code with explanations.
- Buttons for user interaction.



## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Gakwaya011/Input-Validation.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
3. **Run the Application:**

## Input Validation
- **Name Validation:** Ensures the field is not empty.
- **Email Validation:** Checks if the input matches a valid email format.
- **Phone Number Validation:** Ensures the number is of valid length and format.

## Usage
1. Fill in the required fields on the first screen.
2. If the inputs are valid, proceed to the next screen.
3. If validation fails, error messages are displayed.
4. Submit the form to see a confirmation screen.



## Notes
- The user interface is simple but functional.
- Only required components are implemented, as per the assignment guidelines.
- The application follows best practices in structuring and validation.
